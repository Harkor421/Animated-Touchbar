# Animated-Touchbar

This is a simple program I made just for fun to display GIFs in the Macbook touchbar
(for those people like me who still have an Intel Macbook Pro lol). Anyways, the code
is crap and you can only when app is focused.

#### This is how it looks:

Image of how it looks is provided in this same repo.

### If you know a way to make it show even when app is out of focus, feel free to make a PR!
